#### Introduction {#introduction}

The <b>OpenRDM</b> is an open-source library for reduced-density matrix-based analysis and computation.
It adopts the multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MCPDFT) aiming at combining the best of 
both wave function- (WF) and density-based mathods to come up with an approach that can account for both
static and dynamical electron correlation effects in many-body systems.
